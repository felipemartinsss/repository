# repository
Repository containing solutions I implemented for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) using Java/RDDLSim during the time I was a master's student.

I was starting with Git and this repo didn't receive a good name. It should be called something like stochastic-bisimulations-for-mdps-rddlsim.
I didn't rename it because the repo is referenced in the scientific articles I published.
